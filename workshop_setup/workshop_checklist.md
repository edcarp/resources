* Advertise

    * Decide where you want to advertise (internal/external, all university/selected units)  
    * Identify potential groups of attendees (if not known)
    * Gather contact information for people who can disseminate blurbs and registration forms
        * PG mailing lists administrators (ask Giacomo and store in GitHub)
            * email ad about workshop to the PG email addresses - 
              that will result in a very quick sell out of places (use with care)

    * Draft descriptive blurb to send out to possible participants/mailing lists
        * Include a link to a form for possible participants to register interest —
          helps avoid emails saying ‘I’m interested in attending’ that must be kept track of
    * Draft blurb to send out to channels with potential instructors/helpers
        * Include a link to a form where they can register interest/provide information 
          about availability for specific dates/topics: [example here](https://forms.gle/QXkKr1FdxQZpNWog6)
            * Potential places to advertise:
                * Carpentries' Slack — UK channel
                * EdCarp Slack
                * IGMM Slack
                * RSE Slack
                * via colleagues at other Scottish/UK universities


* GitHub side
    * set up a workshop repository on https://github.com/edcarp
        * add GitHub-pages website URL to the repo’s homepage
        * modify `_config.yml` and `index.md` or `index.html` with the appropriate
          metadata and options for the workshop
             * if the workshop is not 'standard', more work may be required to get
               the schedule and setup information correct
                   * this requires some degree of comfort with html
        * make sure the repo is set to public; if it's not, the website won't
          build with the information you've added
    * add  the workshop website URL to https://edcarp.github.io/workshops/
        * how-to
    * inform the Carpentries about the workshop in order to get survey links and
      to ensure instructors/helpers receive credit for their work
    

* Event creation/ticketing platform
    * University system
        * use for in-house workshops for the university
    * Eventbrite


* Platform selection
    * Noteable
        * Can only really be used if every one has a UoE ID
            * Friends of EASE accounts do not work
        * Python2/3 Jupyter notebooks — most scientific libraries available
        * RStudio — may need to ask for uncommon packages to be installed
        * Terminal (though, with limited capabilities)

* Payment
    * Must be eligible to work in the UK - hour-number restrictions may exist for students
    * Collect information on contract types for prospective workers
        * This will affect the payment method
            * See `contract_info.md` or [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wQTtnb6HJAqK-HOGtnlNr5cY1ScX-h0QAvSjc_LQaQQ/edit)
