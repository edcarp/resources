Hello <insert name>,

Thank you very much for showing interest in our workshops! <insert link>
 
<!-- This currently mentions 1 week before; change as needed. -->
Unfortunately, we have to limit registrations to one workshop per person
in order to guarantee a slot for everyone. However, we will register your
interest in a second workshop and add you to its waiting list. If a place
is still available for you one week before the workshop, you will be notified
and allowed to participate.
 
Could you please indicate the workshop for which you would prefer to be registered?
 
Thank you for your understanding.
 
Kind regards,
<name>
