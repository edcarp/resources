Hello <insert name>,

I’m contacting you with regard to some software and data skills workshops, funded by the Scottish Funding Council, and being run by the University of Edinburgh. I am coordinating the workshops and was advised to contact you by Neil Chue Hong, the Director of SSI. Could you please pass this information on to any mailing lists, or to anyone within the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations’ Digital Participation network who might be interested? Some information about the workshops is given below, and full details can be found in the attached pdf.

Interested parties can contact this address for more information: <contact information>.

About the workshops
<!-- Uncomment if this is part of a workshop series
This series of workshops in computational skills is part of <workshop series>. More information about the programme can be found here: <website>.

These courses are intended to help individuals to upskill or reskill in several digital data competency areas, and there is no expectation of previous computational experience. Courses run over 1.5-2.5 days (possibly split across several half days), are highly interactive, and will be delivered remotely, via online platforms, such as Zoom.

Topics for the workshops are generally drawn from the following list. Please indicate which topics may be of interest; if a topic that is not on this list would be of interest let us know, and we will see whether it is possible to include.
• Data organising with spreadsheets
• Data cleaning with OpenRefine
• Data analysis with one of:
    • RStudio
    • Python, or
    • SQL
• Regular expressions and working with data
