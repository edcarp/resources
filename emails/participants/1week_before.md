Zoom use during the workshop:
    • Rename yourself with your full name. ( → Click “Participants” tab, find your name, and click on the rename button)
    • Share your video, if possible. (It is easier to teach when instructors can see people’s faces.)
    • Mute yourself if you are not speaking. (Mute button in the toolbar at the bottom.)
    • Use Zoom non-verbal feedback indicators. ( → Click “Participants” tab to raise hands or give feedback or ask for help.)

Software setup

Make sure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop: <list software>.
Here are the instructions: <link to instructions>. If you have any trouble, send us an email.
  
<!--
Info relevant for Python and Anaconda; uncomment if these are being used.
On Mac OS and Linux, Python3 will already be installed, unless you have a very old operating system. To check, open the Terminal application and run ‘python3 --version’ [enter]. If you don't get a "command not found" error, you're good to go.
If you have a Windows machine or/and you do not have Python3 please download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). More info on Anaconda can be found here (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Please allow plenty of time to install the software (mainly Python) and do get in touch by email as soon as possible if you run into any issues.
